# Fetch-data-Hacker-News-Exercise
This is the Fetch Data Hacker News pagination exercise.

The data source is: http://hn.algolia.com
I followed the course as described, no actual additions from me at this point.
Plans for the future: refactor and address styling choices. Create this file to be a template for other fetch exercises/applications.
